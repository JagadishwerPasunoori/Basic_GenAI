# Description
Data Loaders: Start with various data loaders that read and preprocess data from different formats.

Chunking: The data is chunked into manageable pieces using different chunking methods.

Vectorization: Chunked data is converted into numerical vectors using various vectorization techniques.

Embeddings Methods: Embeddings are generated using different methods to create dense representations.

Vectorstore DBs: Vectors are stored in specialized databases for efficient retrieval.

LLM Inferences: Large Language Models (LLMs) are used for inference to generate text, classify data, or perform other tasks.
